Waliku addresses challenges of school-communities in low resource contexts to recognize and act on critical student absences, illnesses and concerns in a timely manner. It digitizes and simplifies daily tasks of schools \u2013 to manage the school population, communicate with parents\/guardians, link with referral services, and report to school districts.\n\nWaliku\u2019s vision is to ensure every child meets their right to education and well-being. After two years of pilot, Waliku is transitioning its operating model from a donor-funded project to a Save the Children social venture. It will address the needs of its customers - governments and development partners \u2013 with products and services that facilitate children\u2019s access to education, as well as health and welfare services.\n\nCOVID-19-related school closures have caused significant disruption to the education of all children, particularly those marginalized. As schools reopen, it is crucial to ensure that all children return without delay. Schools need tools like Waliku to know they have been effective in bringing students back and respond to those who have not returned. In order to be accessible to many schools, Waliku is diversifying its solution and scaling, initially in Kabupaten Sumba Barat and Bandung, followed by other locations in Eastern Indonesia and West Java.\n\nThrough this paradigm shift in Waliku\u2019s operating model, and scaling our solution in Sumba Barat and introducing it in Bandung, Save the Children Indonesia seeks a Waliku Monitoring, Evaluation, Accounting and Learning (MEAL) Data Analyst for managing Waliku data for both districts.\n\nS\/he will help the Waliku Coordinator with developing tools for school mapping exercises, formative assessments, and data collection, as well as support MEAL plan development, Waliku Dashboard and tools development for district and community stakeholders. S\/he will adhere to child safeguarding and data privacy policies of Waliku, Save the Children and Government of Indonesia.

We process payments, power marketplaces, disburse payroll and loans, provide KYC solutions, prevent fraud, and help businesses grow exponentially. We serve our customers by providing a suite of world-class APIs, eCommerce platform integrations, and easy to use applications for individual entrepreneurs, SMEs, and enterprises alike.\n\nOur main focus is building the most advanced payment rails for Southeast Asia, with a clear goal in mind \u2014 to make payments across in SEA simple, secure and easy for everyone. We serve thousands of businesses ranging from SMEs to multinational enterprises, and process millions of transactions monthly. We've been growing rapidly since our inception in 2015, onboarding hundreds of new customers every month, and backed by global top-10 VCs. We're proud to be featured on among the fastest growing companies by Y-Combinator.\n\nBilling\n\nAs part of the team that designs the billing experience for the customer, you will be tasked with building processes that will impact how Xendit collects fees and charges from the merchant. In designing this system we are looking to minimise the friction involved in settling an invoice. This can be through providing different methods of settling the invoice, providing more flexible payment terms, or creating automated processes that will conveniently settle the billing amount for the merchant without any action needed. As billing performance comes down to how easy and frictionless we can make the experience for the merchant, decreasing the steps needed and procedures in the way of settling an invoice is key to providing a well-rounded billing experience for the customer.\n\nMission\n\nAccurately and reliably deliver billing solutions for all customers.\n\nAccuracy\n\nThe main pillar for our billing documents is the accuracy - as this is the first impression that the merchant can receive in order to build trust with Xendit. When billing documents are correctly calculated with all the fees & charges clearly laid out, the merchant will be able to trust that the billing amount is the right amount.\n\nCreating accurate billing documents requires the ability to handle large volumes of data and understanding the differences between the products that make up the transaction data. In combination with this, the transaction data will need to be manipulated to include the merchant data with agreed rates and any special arrangements.

Based on statistics, 80% transactions are done through bank transfer. Indonesian industries have a host of payment methods that are popular in market, and one of them is Virtual Accounts. There are a lot of industry sectors such as e-commerce, platform, market place, travel, insurance, gaming, (among many others) use Virtual Account as their preferable payment method because of the simplicity, and convenience.

Obviously, slow detection and correction of issues is not acceptable to us, or our customers, so we quickly implemented scalable monitoring and alert tools. Now we can detect any issues within seconds!\n\nCurrently we are focusing on improving our system reliability and scalability using the most current technologies to reduce customer problems and increase customer happiness. One of the big projects we're doing right now is to re-architecture Virtual Account system which will solve some of our crucial technical debt, such as consolidating into one singular source of truth, make consistent flow, and improve extensibility of system.

We\u2019ve witnessed the rise of B2C e-commerce over the last decade in both India and Indonesia. But the small retailer, the heart and soul of retail, has been left largely underserved by e-commerce even though they\u2019re spending hours every day on their smartphones. Ula provides a simple front-end app, powered by sophisticated back-end systems that determine everything from pricing to inventory to intelligent salesforce route planning. We are building many first of their kind technologies in the world and need your help in building the right systems.\n\nUla is an under-the-radar, early-stage technology start-up headquartered in Singapore, with offices in Bangalore and Jakarta though we are quite flexible in terms of where our colleagues choose to work from. We are funded by Tier-1 Venture Capital \u2014 Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed India, Quona Capital and B-Capital Group. It is also backed by prominent industry angels such as the founders of Udaan, Rahul Mehta of DST Capital and other established Indonesian angels.\n\nWe are a culturally diverse company with 38% women and 7 nationalities. We believe that the best minds are required to solve tough problems irrespective of where they come from.\n\nAbout You\n\nYou are driven to solve tough problems with technology. Let\u2019s take pricing for example. Imagine a world where each product in e-commerce were to be priced differently for each customer based on where they are located, how much they buy or where they prepay or pay-later. This leads to a massive optimization problem because pricing too low incurs opportunity cost while pricing too high means a competitor takes that business. This is just one example of how B2B and B2C e-commerce are different and why B2B offers the opportunity to innovate. Now couple this with routing for a sales agent. How should pricing work with a sales-person\u2019s CRM app? Depending on how far you take it, it is a massive machine learning problem.\n\nIf you\u2019re passionate about technology and its applications to business problems, you\u2019re curious and imagine what a new world can look like, love working with global colleagues on global problems and don\u2019t mind taking risks that move the needle and treat failure merely as an opportunity to improve and iterate, you\u2019d be a good fit at Ula.\n\nWe are very ownership driven at Ula. We also believe in proactive mentorship. It\u2019s an opportunity to learn and to mentor.

We\u2019ve witnessed the rise of B2C e-commerce over the last decade in both India and Indonesia. But the small retailer, the heart and soul of retail, has been left largely underserved by e-commerce even though they\u2019re spending hours every day on their smartphones. Ula provides a simple front-end app, powered by sophisticated back-end systems that determine everything from pricing to inventory to intelligent salesforce route planning. We are building many first of their kind technologies in the world and need your help in building the right systems.\n\nUla is an under-the-radar, early-stage technology start-up headquartered in Singapore, with offices in Bangalore and Jakarta though we are quite flexible in terms of where our colleagues choose to work from.

Let\u2019s take pricing for example. Imagine a world where each product in e-commerce were to be priced differently for each customer based on where they are located, how much they buy or where they prepay or pay-later. This leads to a massive optimization problem because pricing too low incurs opportunity cost while pricing too high means a competitor takes that business. This is just one example of how B2B and B2C e-commerce are different and why B2B offers the opportunity to innovate. Now couple this with routing for a sales agent. How should pricing work with a sales-person\u2019s CRM app? Depending on how far you take it, it is a massive machine learning problem.\n\nIf you\u2019re passionate about technology and its applications to business problems, you\u2019re curious and imagine what a new world can look like, love working with global colleagues on global problems and don\u2019t mind taking risks that move the needle and treat failure merely as an opportunity to improve and iterate, you\u2019d be a good fit at Ula.\n\nWe are very ownership driven at Ula.

According to the Statistic Bureau of Indonesia (BPS), the COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 29 million workers in Indonesia as of August 2020, adding to the existing pool of about seven million jobseekers who face significant difficulties in finding a job. While the development of vaccination gives hope, a labour market recovery tends to lag behind an economic recovery. Thus, the number of workers and their families who are affected by the pandemic is likely to stay at a high level throughout 2021 and will eventually see a decline mid-2022. It is therefore urgent to save and create jobs. Business continuity and safety at workplaces are vital to this goal.\n\n\n\nAgainst the backdrop, a new ILO project will promote job creation by enhancing COVID-19 prevention at and through workplaces and improving safety and health for workers, which is an indispensable precondition to business re-opening, continuation and expansion.

While the development of vaccination gives hope, a labour market recovery tends to lag behind an economic recovery. Thus, the number of workers and their families who are affected by the pandemic is likely to stay at a high level throughout 2021 and will eventually see a decline mid-2022. It is therefore urgent to save and create jobs.

We\u2019ve witnessed the rise of B2C e-commerce over the last decade in both India and Indonesia. But the small retailer, the heart and soul of retail, has been left largely underserved by e-commerce even though they\u2019re spending hours every day on their smartphones. Ula provides a simple front-end app, powered by sophisticated back-end systems that determine everything from pricing to inventory to intelligent salesforce route planning. We are building many first of their kind technologies in the world and need your help in building the right systems.\n\nUla is an under-the-radar, early-stage technology start-up headquartered in Singapore, with offices in Bangalore and Jakarta though we are quite flexible in terms of where our colleagues choose to work from. We are funded by Tier-1 Venture Capital \u2014 Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed India, Quona Capital and B-Capital Group. It is also backed by prominent industry angels such as the founders of Udaan, Rahul Mehta of DST Capital and other established Indonesian angels.\n\nWe are a culturally diverse company with 38% women and 7 nationalities. We believe that the best minds are required to solve tough problems irrespective of where they come from.\n\nAbout You\n\nYou are driven to solve tough problems with technology. Let\u2019s take pricing for example. Imagine a world where each product in e-commerce were to be priced differently for each customer based on where they are located, how much they buy or where they prepay or pay-later. This leads to a massive optimization problem because pricing too low incurs opportunity cost while pricing too high means a competitor takes that business. This is just one example of how B2B and B2C e-commerce are different and why B2B offers the opportunity to innovate. Now couple this with routing for a sales agent. How should pricing work with a sales-person\u2019s CRM app? Depending on how far you take it, it is a massive machine learning problem.\n\nIf you\u2019re passionate about technology and its applications to business problems, you\u2019re curious and imagine what a new world can look like, love working with global colleagues on global problems and don\u2019t mind taking risks that move the needle and treat failure merely as an opportunity to improve and iterate, you\u2019d be a good fit at Ula.\n\nWe are very ownership driven at Ula.

# LinkedIn_Data_Scraping

This repository is intended to share my script for pulling data from LinkedIn job portal.
From my experience for a couple of days since I pull data from that web page I have so many tricky problems which is different view if you have login and not log in.
To running this scraping script, you need to download and put Selenium webdriver app for Chrome in the same folder with script file.
You can download it on: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and dont forget to fit your Chrome version.
